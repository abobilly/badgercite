It is designed for the second pass of a citation-generation system: after authorities have been identified and verified, this file provides the typography and citation structure needed to render full and short-form citations correctly, including small‑cap formatting, italics, and roman text.  The rules draw from publicly available Bluebook summaries and the University of Texas Tarlton Law Library guides, which reflect the current edition’s guidance as of August 2025.
