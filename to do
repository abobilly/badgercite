Short answer: you’re close, but you still need reporter/jurisdiction tables, more Texas-specific overrides, and some rendering/QA scaffolding.

What you already have (so we don’t duplicate work): patterns and typefaces for cases/periodicals/statutes (including small caps/italics flags) and several signal/parenthetical rules; plus abbreviation payloads for T6/T7/T8/T9 subsets.   &#x20;

What’s still needed for Pass-2 “render with typography + shortcites” to be solid:

1. Reporter & geography tables: Full Bluebook T1 (preferred reporters) and full T10/T10.1/T10.2/T10.3 lists. Your rules refer out to these but they’re not present, so the engine can’t reliably abbreviate reporters or places or decide whether to omit the state in the court/year parenthetical.&#x20;

2. Remaining abbreviation tables: Complete T11 (Judges & Officials), T12 (Months), T13 (Periodicals), T14 (Publishing Terms), T15 (Services), T16 (Subdivisions). These are referenced in the Bluebook extracts you’re using but aren’t fully captured in the JSONs you attached. &#x20;

3. Texas Greenbook expansions:
   • Normalized court-name strings and districts for COAs, Business Court, and Fifteenth Court of Appeals, including neutral-citation patterns and when to pair them with S.W\.3d. Your current JSON flags these as emerging/uncertain.&#x20;
   • Statute publisher/date parentheticals (e.g., “West”) captured as deterministic templates (right now it’s only prose).&#x20;

4. Statute short-form logic: machine rules for shortening codes/sections (when to use “§§”, when to drop titles, how to cite ranges, how to repeat/non-repeat years and publishers). Your statutes section lacks explicit short-form schemas.&#x20;

5. Services & electronic sources: concrete renderer rules for WL/Lexis/FDsys/GovInfo/agency PDFs (provider strings, currency parentheticals, URL suppression in court filings), including federal-statute “no year” rule as a guardrail. You have the “no year” note and a general digital-materials rule, but not provider-specific templates. &#x20;

6. Shortcite emission rules across authorities: conditions + exact output templates for cases, statutes, books, periodicals, regulations, and internet sources (e.g., when “Id.” is allowed; when “supra”/“hereinafter” can be used; how many footnotes back; how to format pincites in shortcites). You have partial case/secondary rules, but not coverage across all source types. &#x20;

7. Typography rendering spec: a compact “style map” the API can apply uniformly (e.g., HTML spans/classes for <small-caps>, italics, and permissible underline fallback in Bluepages contexts), plus rules for punctuation inside italics and the en-dash vs hyphen requirement for page ranges. You have the concepts, but not a render-layer contract. &#x20;

8. Case-name normalization algorithms: explicit transforms for party-name cleanup (drop given names, “et al.,” business suffixes, generic geo terms; never abbreviate “United States”), wired to T6/T10 for abbreviations. You have prose rules; encode them as deterministic steps with on/off flags and exceptions.&#x20;

9. Parenthetical ordering & content coverage: you’ve started this, but expand with all common weights (per curiam, en banc), quoting/cited-by parentheticals, explanatory verbs, and subsequent-history sequences from T8—each as enumerated lists with canonical strings. &#x20;

10. Error-handling & uncertainty fields: schema slots for “confidence,” “unmapped\_token,” and “needs\_human\_review,” plus a loggable “rule\_source” pointer (Bluebook B-rule/T-table/Greenbook page key) so an API assistant can cite the provision it used. Your JSON already embeds source markers—promote that to first-class fields.&#x20;

11. Ordering logic within citation clauses: a machine rule for “logical order” with tie-breakers (authority type > jurisdiction hierarchy > recency), so multi-authority signals render consistently. You note the principle but not an executable ordering graph.&#x20;

12. Bluepages vs Whitepages toggles: flags to switch between underlining vs italics, optional small caps, and footnote vs text conventions—per document context. You mention permissibility; encode it as a runtime mode. &#x20;

If you add the items above, Pass-2 can deterministically render full cites and shortcites with typography, while emitting a “why” pointer to the governing rule for auditability.
