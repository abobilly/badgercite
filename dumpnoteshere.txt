Here’s my quick take:

Overall approach

* Yes to a vector store: load your Bluebook/Greenbook excerpts + your rules JSON + your test sets. Use it for style/rule grounding, not for primary law. Pair it with live web search for authority lookup/confirmation.
* Pipeline: (1) clean & segment raw paste (dedupe whitespace, fix OCR artifacts), (2) detect task (case vs. statute vs. memo), (3) NER/resolve candidates (party names, reporters, code titles), (4) verify via web, (5) format per Bluepages + Greenbook, (6) emit HTML with typographic tags and shortcites logic.
* Output: HTML for the site with `<i>` (italics), `<u>` (underline—use sparingly), and small caps via CSS (`<span class="sc">` + `.sc{font-variant:small-caps;}`).

Functionality to build in

* Case resolver: fuzzy match on party names + reporter/year hints; confirm with docket/court when available; fill unknowns as “(unknown)” rather than guessing.
* Statute fetcher: exact-match section detection; if text is short, Hash-Indentation exact text; if long, return cite + “link to official/current text” placeholder string (you can swap in a URL on the frontend if you want).
* Shortcite manager: one shortcite per authority per response; for paragraphs, emit trailing “shortcites” block in cited order.
* Texas overrides: S.W./S.W\.2d/S.W\.3d reporters; correct parentheticals (Tex.; Tex. Crim. App.; Tex. App.—City \[Dist.] Year); petition/writ history; Houston districts; Business Court/Fifteenth COA neutral cite if present.
* Confidence & diagnostics: include a lightweight confidence note and list of “authorities\_considered” so you can spot weak matches.

Typography notes

* Bluepages practitioner style is mostly roman; italicize case names and certain procedural phrases. Small caps for court abbreviations works well in HTML via CSS; avoid relying on font-specific small-caps.
* Underline is rarely needed on the web—allow it, but reserve for user-specified emphasis or house style.

Limitations / risks

* Raw OCR noise: garbage punctuation and broken party names will tank resolver accuracy; add a pre-pass normalizer (e.g., join hyphen-broken words, strip zero-width chars).
* Ambiguity: “Smith v. Jones” collisions—must return multiple candidates or mark “Authority unspecified (multiple matches possible).”
* Web reliance: site rate limits, paywalls, and stale pages; you’ll need caching and backoffs. Also beware unofficial aggregators with incorrect metadata.
* Vector store drift: your Bluebook OCR is not authoritative; store it, but don’t let it override verified formats—treat as secondary style guidance.
* Regression coverage: your current test sets are template-y; add edge cases (mem. op., per curiam, subsequent history, en banc, unpublished, session-law enactments, old reporters).

Data you already have (how I’d use it)

* 50\_state\_citation\_rules\_v1\_7.json: rules scaffold; extend with explicit Greenbook fields (petition history, Houston districts, Business Court neutral cites). Add typography hints (italics/small caps/underline flags).
* citation\_tests\_v2\_0.json: wire into CI as format guards (regex), but supplement with semantic checks (court-year consistency, reporter-court compatibility).
* citation\_regression\_set\_v1\_9\_all.jsonl: keep as smoke tests; expand Texas-heavy cases and statutes, especially Penal Code § 42.07/Title 7 speech cases, Health & Safety nuisances, etc.

Implementation tips

* Do a two-pass generation: pass 1 (identify/verify authorities), pass 2 (render with typography + shortcites). Keeps style separate from retrieval.
* Emit a structured JSON alongside HTML (authorities array with fields: type, full\_cite, shortcite, court, year, reporter, status, confidence). Frontend displays HTML; backend stores JSON for analytics.
* Add a strict “no-fabrication” guardrail: if any field is uncertain, leave blank or “(unknown)”—don’t guess pincites or petition histories.

Net: your plan is sound. Use vectors for style/rules, the web for authority truth, and keep rendering deterministic with a small formatter that enforces Bluepages + Greenbook + your shortcite rules.


Short answer: you’re close, but you still need reporter/jurisdiction tables, more Texas-specific overrides, and some rendering/QA scaffolding.

What you already have (so we don’t duplicate work): patterns and typefaces for cases/periodicals/statutes (including small caps/italics flags) and several signal/parenthetical rules; plus abbreviation payloads for T6/T7/T8/T9 subsets.   

What’s still needed for Pass-2 “render with typography + shortcites” to be solid:

1. Reporter & geography tables: Full Bluebook T1 (preferred reporters) and full T10/T10.1/T10.2/T10.3 lists. Your rules refer out to these but they’re not present, so the engine can’t reliably abbreviate reporters or places or decide whether to omit the state in the court/year parenthetical. 

2. Remaining abbreviation tables: Complete T11 (Judges & Officials), T12 (Months), T13 (Periodicals), T14 (Publishing Terms), T15 (Services), T16 (Subdivisions). These are referenced in the Bluebook extracts you’re using but aren’t fully captured in the JSONs you attached.  

3. Texas Greenbook expansions:
   • Normalized court-name strings and districts for COAs, Business Court, and Fifteenth Court of Appeals, including neutral-citation patterns and when to pair them with S.W.3d. Your current JSON flags these as emerging/uncertain. 
   • Statute publisher/date parentheticals (e.g., “West”) captured as deterministic templates (right now it’s only prose). 

4. Statute short-form logic: machine rules for shortening codes/sections (when to use “§§”, when to drop titles, how to cite ranges, how to repeat/non-repeat years and publishers). Your statutes section lacks explicit short-form schemas. 

5. Services & electronic sources: concrete renderer rules for WL/Lexis/FDsys/GovInfo/agency PDFs (provider strings, currency parentheticals, URL suppression in court filings), including federal-statute “no year” rule as a guardrail. You have the “no year” note and a general digital-materials rule, but not provider-specific templates.  

6. Shortcite emission rules across authorities: conditions + exact output templates for cases, statutes, books, periodicals, regulations, and internet sources (e.g., when “Id.” is allowed; when “supra”/“hereinafter” can be used; how many footnotes back; how to format pincites in shortcites). You have partial case/secondary rules, but not coverage across all source types.  

7. Typography rendering spec: a compact “style map” the API can apply uniformly (e.g., HTML spans/classes for <small-caps>, italics, and permissible underline fallback in Bluepages contexts), plus rules for punctuation inside italics and the en-dash vs hyphen requirement for page ranges. You have the concepts, but not a render-layer contract.  

8. Case-name normalization algorithms: explicit transforms for party-name cleanup (drop given names, “et al.,” business suffixes, generic geo terms; never abbreviate “United States”), wired to T6/T10 for abbreviations. You have prose rules; encode them as deterministic steps with on/off flags and exceptions. 

9. Parenthetical ordering & content coverage: you’ve started this, but expand with all common weights (per curiam, en banc), quoting/cited-by parentheticals, explanatory verbs, and subsequent-history sequences from T8—each as enumerated lists with canonical strings.  

10. Error-handling & uncertainty fields: schema slots for “confidence,” “unmapped_token,” and “needs_human_review,” plus a loggable “rule_source” pointer (Bluebook B-rule/T-table/Greenbook page key) so an API assistant can cite the provision it used. Your JSON already embeds source markers—promote that to first-class fields. 

11. Ordering logic within citation clauses: a machine rule for “logical order” with tie-breakers (authority type > jurisdiction hierarchy > recency), so multi-authority signals render consistently. You note the principle but not an executable ordering graph. 

12. Bluepages vs Whitepages toggles: flags to switch between underlining vs italics, optional small caps, and footnote vs text conventions—per document context. You mention permissibility; encode it as a runtime mode.  

If you add the items above, Pass-2 can
